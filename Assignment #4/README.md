# UX within the Public Sector 
## DH150 Assignment 04: Users in Context by Amy Pham 

### Introduction

#### Step 1: Main Design Challenge 
**• What is the main activity your project would support the users?**
> This project will mainly support the users in helping them make more informed choices about fuel economy, such as when purchasing a car or achieving the best fuel economy possible for their current vehicles. 

**• What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
> The basic need involved for that activity is to have accessible information in an easy to use manner. Users should be able to quickly find and understand the information being presented to them. They should not have a difficult experience in wanting to be more fuel economy efficient or environmental friendly. 

**• What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> Current solutions to satisfy these needs are just depending on dealerships or brands of different cars. However, these are not unbiased resouces for information as these sources are involved with the marketing and sales of cars. Additionally, people may also receive a lot of news about the environment and fuel economy through the news, but this may be difficult information to process when just wanting guidance to making informed choices. 

**• What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> Through digital technology, users will not be limited by their sources of information. They could be able to compare different cars side by side without unequal sources or from different sources. Added functionality such as replicating a dealership experience may allow people to feel more encouraged to purchase a car and may help people better navigate the site and their experience.  

#### Step 2: Target Users 
**• What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)** 
> For demographics, the target users are people of legal driving age who drive. Preferably, audiences with the ability to buy their own car or be able to influence the decision of someone purchase. In order to make this as accessible as possible and to reach and as many users as possible, they can have any range of knowledge about cars or fuel economy. 
**• Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
> The users could be researching information about cars anywhere. Most likely, this would be done on their own leisure time, either at home or anywhere with internet access. 
**• What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
> In order to make informed fuel economy choices, the users would be researching different car makes and comparing them. They could also use various calculators to find more information. 

#### Step 3: Research Methods 
> **Participatory Observation and Participation through Card Sorting** were utilized for this project. 
> **Particpatory observation** was used in this in order to directly speak and interact with someone in the target audience. They were able to answer questions about the context, but also be observed while looking online at the website and speaking or giving examples of other tools they would use for the same purpose as this project. 
> **Participation through Card Sorting** was utilized in order to collaborate and find the proper design solutions. The website had many links that seemed to be confusing, especially for my Pilot UT; therefore, it was necessary to bring a new pair of eyes to the links and categories in order to intuitively group links and topics together. 
> Within a **contextual inquiry**, it was possible to learn about the users in their own working environment. My participant was in their room at home with their normal personal/work laptop. This would be where they would msot likely carry out the activities. 

### Research Materials 
**1. Contextual Inquiry Guide**

**2. Card Sorting Activity**

**3. User Data**

### Reflection
#### Insights and Quotes 
**1. How the user would usually find information (1:38)**
> "Usually, there's a brand that I am interested in already. So I will go directly to that brand website and look through there to see a car that fits the class and the price point that I'm looking for."

⋅⋅⋅From this quote, I was able to better understand that this participant would directly go to the brand's website, even though the information there may be biased as a marketing ploy. 

**2. Importance of aesthetics (5:20)** 
> "It's not very attractive. It doesn't make me want to buy any of these cars. It's not selling me on anything."
>

**3. The issue with too much information (6:15)** 
> "There's a lot of information there... There's no one source of truth that you can go to there and you can only look at what's on the brand. And of course, that is a marketing site." 
> 

**4. The understanding of terminology (13:09)**
> "It was very difficult because there was a lot of terminology I did not know."
>
