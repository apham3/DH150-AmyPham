# UX within the Public Sector 
## DH150 Assignment 04: Users in Context by Amy Pham 

### Introduction

#### Step 1: Main Design Challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support the users?**
> This project will mainly support the users in helping them make more informed choices about fuel economy, such as when purchasing a car or achieving the best fuel economy possible for their current vehicles. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
> The basic need involved for that activity is to have accessible information in an easy to use manner. Users should be able to quickly find and understand the information being presented to them. They should not have a difficult experience in wanting to be more fuel economy efficient or environmental friendly. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> Current solutions to satisfy these needs are just depending on dealerships or brands of different cars. However, these are not unbiased resouces for information as these sources are involved with the marketing and sales of cars. Additionally, people may also receive a lot of news about the environment and fuel economy through the news, but this may be difficult information to process when just wanting guidance to making informed choices. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> Through digital technology, users will not be limited by their sources of information. They could be able to compare different cars side by side without unequal sources or from different sources. Added functionality such as replicating a dealership experience may allow people to feel more encouraged to purchase a car and may help people better navigate the site and their experience.  

#### Step 2: Target Users 
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)** 
> For demographics, the target users are people of legal driving age who drive. Preferably, audiences with the ability to buy their own car or be able to influence the decision of someone purchase. In order to make this as accessible as possible and to reach and as many users as possible, they can have any range of knowledge about cars or fuel economy. 
**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
> The users could be researching information about cars anywhere. Most likely, this would be done on their own leisure time, either at home or anywhere with internet access. 
**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
> In order to make informed fuel economy choices, the users would be researching different car makes and comparing them. They could also use various calculators to find more information.
