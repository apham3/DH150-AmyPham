### Scenarios & Journey Maps
#### Scenario 1
Sarah, a full-time high school teacher and mother of two, is excited for her next big lifetime purchase, a new car. After years of saving up, she is definitely mindful about her budget and affordability, hoping to find a vehicle under $25,000. Additionally, Sarah is passionate about the environment and sustainability; because of this, she wants to look into a hybrid car. Sarah's kids are also passionate about sustainability. Because of this, they suggest going online and searching up information about cars. 

User Case: Because Sarah's kids suggest going on the internet to find more information, Sarah does so. However, this becomes quickly overwhelming as there's a lot of links, choices, and terminology that Sarah does not understand about cars. Because of this, she immediately feels frustrated and annoyed in her current situation. Her kids then suggest Fuel Economy. On this website, the newly updated site has minimal links and easy to find features. She is happy to research again. She clicks on the link "2020 Best and Worst Fuel Economy Cars" and easily finds the most efficient compact car and then compares this price to other choices on the list. After customizing the car to what she wants, she goes to her local dealership to negotiate the price and make the final purchase.
