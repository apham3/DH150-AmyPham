### Scenarios & Journey Maps
#### Scenario 1
• Scenario: Sarah, a full-time high school teacher and mother of two, is excited for her next big lifetime purchase, a new car. After years of saving up, she is definitely mindful about her budget and affordability, hoping to find a vehicle under $25,000. Additionally, Sarah is passionate about the environment and sustainability; because of this, she wants to look into a hybrid car. Sarah's kids are also passionate about sustainability. Because of this, they suggest going online and searching up information about cars. 

• User Case: Because Sarah's kids suggest going on the internet to find more information, Sarah does so. However, this becomes quickly overwhelming as there's a lot of links, choices, and terminology that Sarah does not understand about cars. Because of this, she immediately feels frustrated and annoyed in her current situation. Her kids then suggest Fuel Economy. On this website, the newly updated site has minimal links and easy to find features. She is happy to research again. She clicks on the link "2020 Best and Worst Fuel Economy Cars" and easily finds the most efficient compact car and then compares this price to other choices on the list. After customizing the car to what she wants, she goes to her local dealership to negotiate the price and make the final purchase.

#### Scenario 2 
• Scenario: Jason is a second-year college student at the University of California, Los Angeles. His parents have finally agreed to help pitch in for the purchase of his first car. However, because they are paying for the bulk of it, they have the most say in his car choice, but will let him do the reseach and present to them his car choices and reasons; because of this, he needs plenty of information to convince his parents to choose a specific car. Although his parents and him are concerned about price, he is very concerned about the overall look of the car; he wants a car to impress people on his college campus with a more sports car vibe. 

• User Case: As a person is knowledgeable with cars, he becomes frustrated when websites aren't interactive and he can't quickly navigate the page. Jason's parents suggest for him to find his car on the Fuel Economy website. However, since his parents want to be cost efficient, they suggest the Fuel Economy website. The newly updated website had become more interactive to use with links and buttons being highlighted when users hovered over them. Because of this, Jason knew that when he hovered over "Find a Car" and it highlighted that there were more options if he clicked it. After going through "Find a Car" --> "Compare Side by Side," he was able to choose cars and compare them with all their information. He ultimately chose to present to his parents the Honda Accord and Hyndai Sonata.
