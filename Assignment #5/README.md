## DH150 Assignment 05: User Personas & Scenarios by Amy Pham

> The purpose of UX Storytelling is to be able to tell a story from the **user's perspective**. With this knowledge and multiple stories, a researcher will be able to better communicate for the audience. This allows you to live and breathe the users' world and to be able to rule out your own bias and focus on other users. 

### Features
> 1: Minimize the amount of links or information on the main home page 

> 2: Include a search feature in the FAQ/Help section so people can directly search key terms and questions 

> 3: Have better visibility of system status, such as highlighting buttons when hovered

### Scenarios & Journey Maps
#### Scenario 1
• Scenario: Sarah, a full-time high school teacher and mother of two, is excited for her next big lifetime purchase, a new car. After years of saving up, she is definitely mindful about her budget and affordability, hoping to find a vehicle under $25,000. Additionally, Sarah is passionate about the environment and sustainability; because of this, she wants to look into a hybrid car. Sarah's kids are also passionate about sustainability. Because of this, they suggest going online and searching up information about cars. 

• User Case: Because Sarah's kids suggest going on the internet to find more information, Sarah does so. However, this becomes quickly overwhelming as there's a lot of links, choices, and terminology that Sarah does not understand about cars. Because of this, she immediately feels frustrated and annoyed in her current situation. Her kids then suggest Fuel Economy. On this website, the newly updated site has minimal links and easy to find features. She is happy to research again. She clicks on the link "2020 Best and Worst Fuel Economy Cars" and easily finds the most efficient compact car and then compares this price to other choices on the list. After customizing the car to what she wants, she goes to her local dealership to negotiate the price and make the final purchase.

#### Scenario 2 
• Scenario: Jason is a second-year college student at the University of California, Los Angeles. His parents have finally agreed to help pitch in for the purchase of his first car. However, because they are paying for the bulk of it, they have the most say in his car choice, but will let him do the reseach and present to them his car choices and reasons; because of this, he needs plenty of information to convince his parents to choose a specific car. Although his parents and him are concerned about price, he is very concerned about the overall look of the car; he wants a car to impress people on his college campus with a more sports car vibe. 

• User Case: As a person is knowledgeable with cars, he becomes frustrated when websites aren't interactive and he can't quickly navigate the page. Jason's parents suggest for him to find his car on the Fuel Economy website. However, since his parents want to be cost efficient, they suggest the Fuel Economy website. The newly updated website had become more interactive to use with links and buttons being highlighted when users hovered over them. Because of this, Jason knew that when he hovered over "Find a Car" and it highlighted that there were more options if he clicked it. After going through "Find a Car" --> "Compare Side by Side," he was able to choose cars and compare them with all their information. He ultimately chose to present to his parents the Honda Accord and Hyndai Sonata.

#### Scenario 3
• Scenario: Alice is a full-time data analyst in New York City. However, due to her marriage and her age, she has been wanting to move to the suburbs and out of the busy city. Due to this move, Alice needs a new car to help her navigate the new community since she can't rely on public transportation like in New York City anymore. She hopes to easily find a clean list that will tell her exactly the top-rated cars of the year that is also a well-known or luxurious brand; if it happens to be environmentally-friendly, she hopes it will impress her friends and family. 

• User Case: When searching up information about cars, she finds the Fuel Economy website. Although her initial wants don't have to do the environment, she realizes that since it's a .gov website, it must be somewhat reliable for information. Because of this, she continues onto the website. However, due to her lack of car knowledge and impatient mannerisms, she becomes frustrated with finding her list. To combat this, she goes to the FAQ/Help section that had just been updated. Here, she is able to directly search "Top Ranked Cars of 2019" and find results on where to find such lists on the website. Due to this new feature, she does not have to endlessly scroll and navigate around the page. After finding the list of the Top Ranked Cars, she decides to make a trip to town in order to purchase her new Tesla 3 Standard Range Plus.
