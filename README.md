# UX for Public Awareness 
## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Amy Pham 

Governmental departments and public service organizations are created to help everyday communities by providing municipial services, information, and resources. However, the public sector is difficult to navigate due to lack of accessibility, language barriers, educational differences, and so forth. Because of this, many groups utilize websites as a platform to communicate with their constituents and to provide further assistance. The first website is for Fuel Economy, which is a federal government website dedicated to help consumers make better informed fuel economy choices. The second website is for the County of Orange's Superior Court, serving the community by administering justice and resolving disputes related to various types of law. Through the improvement of the UX design for these websites, I can help everyday citizens better navigate the public sector system in order to find the help they deserve.
