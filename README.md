# UX for Public Awareness 
## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Amy Pham 

Governmental departments and public service organizations are created to help everyday communities by providing municipial services, information, and resources. However, the public sector is difficult to navigate due to lack of accessibility, language barriers, educational differences, and so forth. Because of this, many groups utilize websites as a platform to communicate with their constituents and to provide further assistance. The first website is for Fuel Economy, which is a federal government website dedicated to help consumers make better informed fuel economy choices. The second website is for the County of Orange's Superior Court, serving the community by administering justice and resolving disputes related to various types of law. Through the improvement of the UX design for these websites, I can help everyday citizens better navigate the public sector system in order to find the help they deserve. 

## Website 1: Fuel Economy 
Link: https://fueleconomy.gov/
The Fuel Economy website has a plethora of information and reources. However, when entering the website for the first time, the home page seems to be overwhelmed with links and a lot of text. Here are a few of the main UX issues that could be improved for the website: overwhelming amount of text, unclear titles, unclear purposes for website features, and and so forth.

## Website 2: The Superior Court of California: County of Orange 
Link: https://www.occourts.org/
The Superior Court of California: County of Orange website has many features, such as self-help, forms and filing, jury services, etc. The main home page of the website seems to be overwhelmed with information with multiple items being bolded or marked in a different color to be more important, but there's multiple items that are marked in this manner, which is confusing. Here are a few of the main UX issues that could be improved for the website: overwhelming amount of text, consistency, pixelated text (difficult on the eyes), etc.

### 1. Visibility of System Status 
The visibility of system status keeps the users informed about what is going on with the website. 

• Rating (3): When hovering over the navigation bar, the links turn to a different color of gray, but it is not easily visible. By making it more visible, users will know that they are interacting with the page.
