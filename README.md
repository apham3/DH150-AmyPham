# UX for Public Awareness 
## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Amy Pham 

Governmental departments and public service organizations are created to help everyday communities by providing municipial services, information, and resources. However, the public sector is difficult to navigate due to lack of accessibility, language barriers, educational differences, and so forth. Because of this, many groups utilize websites as a platform to communicate with their constituents and to provide further assistance. The first website is for Fuel Economy, which is a federal government website dedicated to help consumers make better informed fuel economy choices. The second website is for the County of Orange's Superior Court, serving the community by administering justice and resolving disputes related to various types of law. Through the improvement of the UX design for these websites, I can help everyday citizens better navigate the public sector system in order to find the help they deserve. 

## Website 1: Fuel Economy 
Link: https://fueleconomy.gov/
The Fuel Economy website has a plethora of information and reources. However, when entering the website for the first time, the home page seems to be overwhelmed with links and a lot of text. Here are a few of the main UX issues that could be improved for the website: overwhelming amount of text, unclear titles, unclear purposes for website features, and and so forth.

## Website 2: The Superior Court of California: County of Orange 
Link: https://www.occourts.org/
The Superior Court of California: County of Orange website has many features, such as self-help, forms and filing, jury services, etc. The main home page of the website seems to be overwhelmed with information with multiple items being bolded or marked in a different color to be more important, but there's multiple items that are marked in this manner, which is confusing. Here are a few of the main UX issues that could be improved for the website: overwhelming amount of text, consistency, pixelated text (difficult on the eyes), etc.

## Heuristic Evaluation - Website 1: Fuel Economy 
### 1. Visibility of System Status 
The visibility of system status keeps the users informed about what is going on with the website. 

• Rating (3): When hovering over the navigation bar, the links turn to a different color of gray, but it is not easily visible. By making it more visible, users will know that they are interacting with the page.

### 2. Match Between Systems and The Real World 
The system should refect real world conventions, matching the digital space to the physical space. 

• The website includes images and icons that reflect the real world. This is helpful to users if they are not familar with specific terms, but are able to recognize the images or icons.

### 3. User Control and Freedom 
This allows users to easily exit or back out of an action on the website without extra trouble. 

•

### 4. Consistency and Standards 
Specific words, actions, and symbols should mean the same thing. 

### 5. Error Prevention 
Design prevents prevents problems from occurring. 

• Rating (2): When typing an entry into the search bar, if the entry is not the exact spelling or phrase found on the website, the website will just return 0 results and does not provide any help to avoid such errors. The website can help reduce these errors by providing common search terms, autocorrect, and so forth.

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall 

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 
Design should only include necessary and relevant information. 


### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
The website's error messages should be in plain language, understandable, and with steps to further take. 

• Rating (2): When random text is included in the URL, there is a 404 Not Found error page. The error page does well in the fact that it states possible reason why the page is wrong, but it does not indicate further steps to take. We could suggest for users to return to the home page or redirect them to a help page.

### 10. Help and Documentation
