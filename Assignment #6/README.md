# UX within the Public Sector 
## DH150 Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Prototype by Amy Pham 

### Description of Project 
**Purpose**
The purpose of the low-fidelity prototype is to figure out exactly how a user would interact with the website. From creating this low-fidelity protoype, it is possible to visualize their exact steps while allowing me to test it on an actual person in order to see their reactions and gain feedback on their interactions. 

**User Research Summary**


####  Tasks 
**1. Find info about a car with the best fuel economy**
> Through the user research, I noticed that the links on the website and dropdown menu when hovering were not apparent. Through this task from one of my user scenarios, their wll interactions with the navigation bar, links, and the overall Find a Car tool, which will be redesigned. 

**2. Find the newest sporty car with the best MPG**
>

**3. Easily search for the top ranked cars of 2020**
feature in the FAQ/Help section so people can directly search key terms and questions**

### Reflection

#### Prototype Testing 

Specifically, for each task, I was able to see issues that the tester encountered: 
**1. Find info about a car with the best fuel economy**
> From my prototype testing, I was able to learn that the groupings for the navigation bar titles were not intuitive. The user would have looked under "Find a Car" to look for the car with the most fuel economy rather than "Save Money and Fuel" as they guessed that would be for more articles and advice on how to save. 

**2. Find the newest sporty car with the best MPG**
> When changing the year, car class, and MPG for the Find a Car search, the user was confused about how the pop-ups for the choices would appear on the screen. However, after looking at the next wireframes, they were able to see that it would have dropdown screen that would disappear after the user made a choice. For the high-fidelity prototype and the website overall, I would include a hovering feature, so that users could visualize the interaction in real-time. 

**3. Easily search for the top ranked cars of 2020**
> This main task was to highlight the search feature. By having it in the navigation bar and in the middle of the home screen, the user was able to easily search. However, before looking at all the wireframes, my user stated that they would intuitively hover and look at all the options in the navigation bar before doing a search since keywords or phrases may not get the most accurate results. Therefore, I would include top rankings also in the navigation bar.
