# UX within the Public Sector 
## DH150 Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Prototype by Amy Pham 

### Description of Project 
**Purpose**
The purpose of the low-fidelity prototype is to figure out exactly how a user would interact with the website. From creating this low-fidelity protoype, it is possible to visualize their exact steps while allowing me to test it on an actual person in order to see their reactions and gain feedback on their interactions. 

**User Research Summary**
From my previous user research, the main issues found on the website were related to the overwhelming amount of information on the site's main home page and also how links/buttons were not distinct from unclickable body text. Because of this, I combined these two trouble areas with the everyday tasks that users would have in order to create my low-fidelity prototype. 

####  Tasks 
**1. Find info about a car with the best fuel economy**
> Through the user research, I noticed that the links on the website and dropdown menu when hovering were not apparent. Through this task from one of my user scenarios, their wll interactions with the navigation bar, links, and the overall Find a Car tool, which will be redesigned. 

**2. Find the newest sporty car with the best MPG**
> I wanted the "Find the Car" feature to be more apparent and for the links and drop menus to be visible for users as they search for their features and functions on the site. 

**3. Easily search for the top ranked cars of 2020**
> From the user research, I decided to add a more visible area for users to search their questions. For later prototypes, I will also combine this search option in the FAQ section for more difficult requests.

### Reflection
For the creation of the low-fidelity prototype, it was interesting to see how many different states and interactions the website would go through for a single task. Personally, since the original website did not show its system status well to the user, I really wanted to incopororate drop down menus and hovering as the main feature; however, this was difficult to prototype on paper for each hovering state. Additionally, although I wanted to make these links more apparent, I also didn't create page for all of these links since there are many on the site. 

Specifically, for each task, I was able to see issues that the tester encountered: 

**1. Find info about a car with the best fuel economy**
> From my prototype testing, I was able to learn that the groupings for the navigation bar titles were not intuitive. The user would have looked under "Find a Car" to look for the car with the most fuel economy rather than "Save Money and Fuel" as they guessed that would be for more articles and advice on how to save. For future prototyping, I would try to narrow down more specific tasks, rather than incorporating too mayn features and changes at once. 

**2. Find the newest sporty car with the best MPG**
> When changing the year, car class, and MPG for the Find a Car search, the user was confused about how the pop-ups for the choices would appear on the screen. However, after looking at the next wireframes, they were able to see that it would have dropdown screen that would disappear after the user made a choice. For the high-fidelity prototype and the website overall, I would include a hovering feature, so that users could visualize the interaction in real-time. 

**3. Easily search for the top ranked cars of 2020**
> This main task was to highlight the search feature. By having it in the navigation bar and in the middle of the home screen, the user was able to easily search. However, before looking at all the wireframes, my user stated that they would intuitively hover and look at all the options in the navigation bar before doing a search since keywords or phrases may not get the most accurate results. Therefore, I would include top rankings also in the navigation bar.
