# UX within the Public Sector 
## DH150 Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing by Amy Pham 

### Introduction 
Fuel Economy is the official U.S. government source for fuel economy information. The website is dedicated to helping consumers make informed fuel economy choices when purchasing vehicles and achieve the best fuel economy possible. 

#### Purpose of UT: 
The purpose of usability testing is gain more information and feedback on how to improve the website. By having participants actually performing tasks, navigating the websites, and voicing their thoughts and concerns, we are able to better understand issues on the website that can be improved for the future. Usability testing, in combination with the information from the heuristic evaluation, allow us to better overall improve the user experience. 

#### Some of the main usability issues I found in the heuristic evaluation to test:
     â€¢ Navigation bar is not apparent. From the heuristic evaluation, the navigation bar does not move with the user as they scroll and is not overall very apparent in the website's design. 


### Methodology 
For the pilot usability test, due to the circumstances, I performed remote UTs for both of my participants. Participants were invited to a Zoom call, where they opened the survey and Fuel Economy website. Zoom allowed me to record the participant's screen as they screenshared, their video, and audio. I performed two pilot usability tests since my first one was flawed.

### Pilot UT Videos 
For this, I carried out two pilot usability tests. For my first one, my survey had an issue and I believe I may have influenced the participant. Because of this, I conducted a second UT, where the survey was fixed and I was more of an unbiased moderator.

### Reflection & Possible Improvements
With the information from the first and second UT, I was able to gain valuable insight about the website and even the survey. Although the first UT could have gone more smoothly, it allowed me to see that the survey was flawed, which may have influenced the user's overall experience with the Fuel Economy website.
